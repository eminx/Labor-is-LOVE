# Labor is LOVE

## What is it?
This is a theme gathering with the absolute theme being `labor in the 21st Century`.

What I organised as the gathering was to first have a lot of people from extremely varying disciplines gathered in a giant dance theatre (which is just an empty space with soft floor). Then I asked them to make small presentations to each other, with a medium and content they choose. From poetry to workshops, it was very diverse yet sophisticated. We have cooperated from beginning to the end.

The goal is to have such gatherings more in order to create a culture that promotes sharing, gathering and discussing more to embrace and transform the "work" conditions in the future, to one in which we can love the labor we do in our everyday lives.

## Labor in the 21st century
Is it possible to think that the concept of labor in the future may be purely self-driven, pleasurable and artistic contribution at such service of a society?

Can it be more emancipated from the hegemony of external powers; such as a widespread economic system, state apparatus, profit-based corporations, state-run agencies, or any other factor than:

* the very well-being of the workers,
* their inter-relations,
* the society in which they cohabit,
* and the ecology itself?

We want to articulate with you about how we can bring about:

* **value beyond commodities,**
* **benefit beyond profits,**
* **contribution beyond borders**

in the rest of the _21st century_.


## Background
The triggering force for this event has been the current situation of foreign labor practitioners in Sweden, which consists of a range of people from different parts of the world, doing labor of any kind from IT to service industry. Their struggle with deportations from the country where they ‘legally’ lived for many years, and being left miserable without the support of unions and government bodies in such a country like Sweden; has become a driving force for a re-articulation of the mechanisms of labor laws and policies, not only in state-wise; but also international context.

With the radical changes in capital flow and economic dynamics, and mass-scale mobility in the world with a number of opportunities and crisis; having such gatherings is rather an inevitable condition for the greater good.
